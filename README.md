# Quay

Quay is an open source, high performance backend for the Seaport smart 
contracts. The project is implemented in Rust, using Postgres as a storage
backend, with the aim of allowing a proliferation of signature based 
trading platforms for ERC-721s and ERC-1155s based on the Seaport smart 
contract interface.
